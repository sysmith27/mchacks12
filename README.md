# The Breadding of the Century
## Inspiration
We were inspired to create this project by the beauty of bread!! As for why we decided to make a game, it provided the best way for all team members to contribute with varying levels of experience.
## What it does
Our game aims to bring joy to people!! It uses a randomized maze map, dynamic obstacles such as rain clouds and randomly appearing fires that end the round if you run into them. We created a chaotic game with very cute graphics thanks to our artist Sophia!!!
## How we built it
We built our project using Javascript for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. Finally, we used Procreate to create the visuals such as the logo and all the characters. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges in making the API to pass the user's choice of character to the maze screen. But after looking over opensource projects that used a localStorage system as a very simple API we were able to figure out how to get our responses from one page to another. Another challenge we ran into was the implementation of the bread-themed music as it would only play on one person's computer, but we researched the issue and discovered it was an issue with the browser that we quickly resolved.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some things we're proud of for this project are the character designs and theme, and the maze obstacles' complexity. We're very proud of how we collaborated to bring our idea to life so fully in just 24 hours, especially when half of our team has very little coding experience in the languages we used!
## What we learned
In making this game, we learned a lot about CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the concepts of a very basic API.
## What's next for Breadding of the Century
A Honeymoon!! Future additions would include more levels and more about our favourite couple's favourite couple. New levels would include more obstacles, more complex paths, and multiplayer capacity so that the couple could play against each other in a friendly competition.
