# Breadding of the Century
![mchacks-log](images/mchacks-logo.png)
## Inspiration 🥖
🍞 We were inspired to create this project by the beauty of **bread**!! 😋 We decided to make a web-based game since it was the best way for all team members to contribute with varying levels of experience.
## What it does 🕹️
Our game aims to bring joy to people!! It uses a **randomized maze map**, **dynamic obstacles** such as rain clouds 🌧️ and randomly appearing fires 🔥 that end the round if you run into them. We created a chaotic game with very cute graphics thanks to our artist Sophia!!!
## How we built it ✨
We built our project using Javascript for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. Finally, we used Procreate to create the visuals such as the logo and all the characters. 
## Challenges we ran into 😔
We ran into some challenges when making the API to pass the user's choice of character to the maze screen. But after looking over opensource projects that used a localStorage system as a very simple API we were able to figure out how to get our responses from one page to another. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🌟
Some things we're proud of for this project are the character designs and theme, and the maze obstacles' complexity. We're very proud of how we collaborated to bring our idea to life so fully in just 24 hours, especially when half of our team has very little coding experience! 
## What we learned 🪜
While making this game, we learned a lot about CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
## What's next for _Breadding of the Century_ 👰🤵 
A Honeymoon!! 😉 Future additions would include a second level and more about _our favourite couple's favourite couple_.  🍞♥️🥐
